My .apk files are in the build folder, and CustomBall.apk is the one with my own ideas implemented. The photo is in this main folder.

My game was inspired by cornhole and the original directions to have a ball shoot out of the target. I have edited the ButtonClick code given to shoot the ball once per click or touch instead, and determine the power of the shot based on how long the click or touch was. The ball also changes color from green to red based on how hard it is fired. The goal of the game is to aim for the cylinders along the wall. There are a few ways to go about it. You can aim to have the ball touch the top of the cylinder, or you can aim to have the ball stop on the floor as close to the cylinders as possible. This is a problem solving activity, and the physics of the ball in response to how long the touch is held provides surprises. Thus, it matches our definitions of a game from class.
